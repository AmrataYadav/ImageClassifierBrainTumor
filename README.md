# Brain Tumor Image Classifier

This project demonstrates my understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by building and training a model from scratch using TensorFlow 2.18. The model is designed to classify brain tumor images with high precision and accuracy.

## Key Highlights

- **Custom CNN Architecture**: Implemented and trained from scratch.
- **Performance**: Achieved Precision: 0.992, Recall: 1.000, Accuracy: 0.995.
- **Technology**: Built using TensorFlow 2.18.
